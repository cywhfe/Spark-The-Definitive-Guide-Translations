According to the article:

> In partnership with Oâ€™Reilly Media, we will publish this new comprehensive book on Spark later this year. [**To celebrate the largest Spark Summit ever, we are releasing several chapters for free to the community**](http://go.databricks.com/definitive-guide-apache-spark). 

> For your preliminary viewing of the book, we are providing a preview copy of the contents of the book for anyone to [download and read](http://go.databricks.com/definitive-guide-apache-spark), free of charge. This sample is the unedited sample of the current Definitive Guide.

As a Spark user, I hope more people can use Spark with data processing works. But there are language gaps with our daily works to read docs and books. So I start this project to translate the preview book chapters to our own languages.

And I'm trying contact Databricks to know our contributions on Spark.
